weakly-universal-hash
=====================

Demonstrative project illustrating the weakly-universal Hp,m set of hashing functions.

Weakly-universal hashing functions are guaranteed to have a collision probability upper bounded by 1/m, where m is the size of the table.

```
Pr(h(x) = h(y)) <= 1/m
```
